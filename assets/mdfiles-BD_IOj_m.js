# Deployment Profile: Connecting Rural Schools (NOTE: THIS IS AI GENERATED)\r
\r
In the rolling hills of rural Rwanda, a remarkable educational transformation is underway. A volunteer-driven initiative launched in 2021 has successfully deployed technology in more than 50 schools, reaching over 15,000 students. This is the story of how a small team of dedicated educators and technologists is changing the educational landscape in one of Africa's most ambitious countries.\r
\r
## Origins and Vision\r
\r
The initiative began as a weekend project by a software developer who returned to Rwanda after studying abroad. "I grew up in a village without electricity, let alone computers," the developer explains. "When I saw the potential to work on low-cost hardware with minimal infrastructure, I knew it could work here."\r
\r
With support from the global community and a small grant from a local tech company, the developer assembled a team of five volunteers:\r
\r
- Two software developers\r
- Two teachers\r
- One solar power technician\r
\r
Their vision: to create sustainable, community-supported computer labs in rural Rwandan schools.\r
\r
### The Deployment Model\r
\r
What makes this initiative unique is its holistic approach:\r
\r
1. **Hardware Sourcing** - Refurbished laptops from international donors\r
2. **Power Solution** - Simple solar panel systems sufficient to charge laptops\r
3. **Technical Setup** - Custom builds with local language localization\r
4. **Teacher Training** - Intensive workshops for educators\r
5. **Ongoing Support** - Regular follow-up visits and remote assistance\r
6. **Community Engagement** - Involving parents and local leaders\r
\r
![Solar-powered computer lab](assets/Images/learn.jpg)\r
\r
## Implementation Challenges\r
\r
The path to 50 schools was not without obstacles:\r
\r
| Challenge | Solution |\r
|-----------|----------|\r
| Unreliable power | Solar charging systems with battery storage |\r
| Limited internet | Offline content library and activity packs |\r
| Teacher technical confidence | Peer teaching model and extended training |\r
| Hardware durability | Protective cases and basic repair training |\r
| Local language support | Translations by volunteer team |\r
\r
"Our biggest challenge wasn't technical—it was convincing school leaders that computers could work reliably in their environment," says one of the teacher trainers with the project. "We had to demonstrate that this isn't fragile technology requiring constant maintenance and internet."\r
\r
### The School Selection Process\r
\r
The initiative developed a careful process for selecting partner schools:\r
\r
1. **Interest application** - Schools submit a statement of interest\r
2. **Site assessment** - Team evaluates infrastructure and community support\r
3. **Partnership agreement** - Clear responsibilities for all parties\r
4. **Teacher identification** - Selection of motivated teacher-champions\r
5. **Community meeting** - Engagement with parents and local leaders\r
6. **Implementation planning** - Customized timeline for each school\r
\r
> "We don't just drop off computers and leave. We build relationships with each school community, understanding their specific needs and circumstances. This takes more time but leads to sustainable deployments."\r
\r
![Solar-powered computer lab](assets/Images/learn.jpg)\r
\r
## Impact Stories\r
\r
The impact of the initiative extends beyond digital literacy:\r
\r
### Primary School\r
\r
In this remote eastern school, students used record and write activities to document local agricultural practices, creating an illustrated guide that has been shared with neighboring communities.\r
\r
### Girls School\r
\r
Female students who were initially hesitant to use technology have become so proficient that they now run weekly coding clubs using various activities.\r
\r
### Community School\r
\r
Teachers report that attendance has increased by 25% since the computer lab was established, with parents noting that children are more eager to attend school.\r
\r
## Sustainability Approach\r
\r
For long-term sustainability, the initiative has implemented several key strategies:\r
\r
- **Technical Champions** - Each school has 2-3 teachers with advanced training\r
- **Repair Network** - Regional volunteer technicians who can respond to hardware issues\r
- **School Exchanges** - Regular meetings between participating schools to share best practices\r
- **Income Generation** - Some schools offer community computer time after hours for a small fee\r
- **Government Engagement** - Close coordination with Rwanda's Ministry of Education\r
\r
"We're building capabilities, not dependencies," the developer emphasizes. "Every aspect of our model aims to eventually make our organization unnecessary."\r
\r
## Future Plans\r
\r
Looking ahead, the initiative has ambitious plans:\r
\r
1. Expand to 100 schools by 2027\r
2. Develop more culturally-specific activities\r
3. Create a teacher training certification\r
4. Establish a hardware refurbishing center in Kigali\r
5. Launch a student developer program for secondary schools\r
\r
"What keeps us motivated is seeing the creativity this unleashes," says one of the trainers. "These children, many who had never seen a computer before, are now creating animations, writing stories, and solving complex problems. They're not just consuming technology—they're creating with it."\r

# Teacher Spotlight: Transforming Classrooms with Sugar (NOTE: THIS IS AI GENERATED)\r
\r
In small rural communities around the world, dedicated educators are sparking educational revolutions. With limited resources but boundless creativity, they are transforming their classrooms using Sugar, creating opportunities their students never thought possible.\r
\r
## A Challenging Educational Environment\r
\r
When one teacher began their journey at a rural primary school five years ago, the challenges seemed insurmountable:\r
\r
- The school had only a few aging computers for many students\r
- Intermittent electricity and no internet connection\r
- Many students had never used a computer before\r
- Limited educational resources in their native language\r
\r
"Most of my students come from families of farmers and artisans," the teacher explains. "Technology seemed like something from another world to them. But I believed that digital literacy would be essential for their futures."\r
\r
### The Sugar Solution\r
\r
This teacher discovered Sugar at a regional educational workshop. They were immediately drawn to Sugar's:\r
\r
- Offline functionality - perfect for their unreliable infrastructure\r
- Child-friendly interface - accessible to first-time computer users  \r
- Open-source philosophy - allowing for adaptations to local contexts\r
- Activity-based learning - engaging students through creation rather than consumption\r
\r
## Implementation Journey\r
\r
The implementation of Sugar followed these steps:\r
\r
1. **Preparation Phase** (3 months)\r
   - Installed Sugar on the school's computers\r
   - Learned the platform through online tutorials\r
   - Created a curriculum integrating Sugar with traditional subjects\r
\r
2. **Student Introduction** (1 month)\r
   - Basic computer skills training\r
   - Introduction to the Sugar interface\r
   - First explorations with simple Activities\r
\r
3. **Curriculum Integration** (Ongoing)\r
   - Mathematics with Turtle Art\r
   - Language learning with Write\r
   - Science exploration with Measure\r
   - Cultural preservation with Record\r
\r
> "The first time my students realized they could create their own animations with TurtleArt, their eyes lit up. They stayed after school for hours, programming intricate designs inspired by our local textiles. That's when I knew Sugar was special."\r
\r
### Measuring Success\r
\r
The results of the Sugar implementation have been remarkable:\r
\r
| Metric | Before Sugar | After Sugar |\r
|--------|--------------|-------------|\r
| Student attendance | 78% | 94% |\r
| Math proficiency | 45% | 72% |\r
| Student-initiated projects | Rare | Weekly |\r
| Parent involvement | 30% | 85% |\r
\r
## Community Impact\r
\r
The benefits have extended beyond academic measures:\r
\r
- Students have created digital stories documenting local traditions\r
- Parents are now attending computer literacy sessions after school hours\r
- The community has developed a digital archive of their native language\r
- Students have started teaching younger children how to use Sugar\r
\r
The teacher noted a particularly significant moment: "When the elders of our community saw their stories being preserved digitally by the children, they understood the value of this technology. It wasn't taking away from our culture—it was helping preserve it."\r
\r
## Advice for Other Educators\r
\r
Based on their experience, the teacher offers these suggestions for implementing Sugar:\r
\r
1. Start small with a few key activities\r
2. Connect Sugar projects to local cultural contexts\r
3. Create peer teaching opportunities\r
4. Involve parents and community members\r
5. Document and share students' creations\r
\r
"The beauty of Sugar is that it works with what you have," the teacher says. "You don't need the latest technology or constant internet access. You just need curiosity and creativity—which children naturally have in abundance."\r
\r
This educator continues to advocate for Sugar in their region, conducting workshops for other teachers and speaking at educational conferences. Their classroom has become a model for technology integration in resource-limited settings, demonstrating how open-source educational tools can create rich learning environments anywhere in the world.\r

# Connected Through Technology: Our Rural-Urban Classroom Partnership  (NOTE: THIS IS AI GENERATED)\r
\r
In an era where technology often divides us, we discovered how it could build meaningful connections between children from vastly different backgrounds. This is the story of how our classrooms—one in a rural area and one in a suburban city—formed a year-long partnership that changed our students' perspectives on the world and each other.\r
\r
## Two Different Worlds\r
\r
Our schools couldn't be more different:\r
\r
**Rural School**\r
- Small school with limited students\r
- Limited technology resources (few computers for the entire school)\r
- Intermittent internet access\r
- Many students from farming families\r
- Local language as primary language\r
\r
**Suburban School**\r
- Large school with many students\r
- 1:1 laptop program\r
- High-speed internet throughout campus\r
- Students from mostly professional families\r
- English as primary language\r
\r
> "When we first proposed this partnership, many colleagues were skeptical. How could students with such different realities find common ground? What we discovered was that children's creativity transcends these differences when given the right tools."\r
> - Teacher from Rural School\r
\r
## Finding a Common Platform\r
\r
The partnership began when a teacher from the suburban school visited the rural school as part of an educator exchange program. While visiting, they discovered they were both using the same educational platform.\r
\r
"It was an 'aha' moment," the suburban teacher recalls. "Despite our different contexts, we were using the same platform. The emphasis on creation rather than consumption meant our students could collaborate meaningfully despite their different resources."\r
\r
We identified three key advantages that made the platform perfect for our cross-cultural partnership:\r
\r
1. **Low technical requirements** - The platform runs well even on older computers\r
2. **Journal system** - Easy to share projects asynchronously when real-time connections weren't possible\r
3. **Visual interface** - Reduced language barriers through its iconic design\r
4. **Creation focus** - Enabled students to create and share their unique perspectives\r
\r
\r
## Our Collaboration Framework\r
\r
We structured our partnership around four collaborative projects spread throughout the academic year:\r
\r
| Project | Activities | Focus |\r
|---------|------------|-------|\r
| Community Mapping | Map, Paint, Record | Students documented important places in their communities |\r
| Local Traditions | Write, Record, Portfolio | Students shared cultural traditions and celebrations |\r
| Environmental Monitoring | Measure, Chart, Write | Students gathered and compared environmental data |\r
| Mathematical Art | TurtleArt, Portfolio | Students created art based on mathematical principles |\r
\r
### Community Mapping Project\r
\r
Our first collaboration revealed both the challenges and potential of our partnership. Students used the platform's Map and Paint activities to create visual representations of their communities, adding audio recordings describing important locations.\r
\r
**From the rural students**, suburban students learned about:\r
- Life in a rural agricultural community\r
- The central importance of the weekly market\r
- How natural features like rivers shape daily life\r
\r
**From the suburban students**, rural students discovered:\r
- The complexity of urban transportation systems\r
- The diversity of a large city\r
- The concept of shopping malls and movie theaters\r
\r
The initial exchanges were somewhat hesitant, with students unsure how to relate to such different realities. But curiosity quickly overcame awkwardness.\r
\r
## Overcoming Challenges\r
\r
Our partnership faced several significant challenges:\r
\r
### Technical Limitations\r
The rural school's internet connection was unreliable, making real-time video calls difficult. We adapted by:\r
- Creating an asynchronous sharing system using the platform's Journal\r
- Scheduling video calls during optimal connectivity times\r
- Preparing backup offline activities when internet failed\r
\r
### Language Barriers\r
With different primary languages, communication could have been difficult. We addressed this through:\r
- Bilingual teacher facilitation\r
- The platform's visual interface reducing reliance on text\r
- Basic language exchange components in our projects\r
- Paired students with complementary language skills\r
\r
### Cultural Misunderstandings\r
Initial interactions revealed some stereotypes and misconceptions. We tackled these through:\r
- Guided reflection activities\r
- Direct addressing of stereotypes when they emerged\r
- Emphasis on individual stories rather than generalizations\r
\r
> "When my students first saw the suburban classroom with a laptop for every child, some felt embarrassed about our modest computer lab. But as the projects progressed, they realized that creativity isn't about having the most resources—it's about how you use what you have."\r
> - Teacher from Rural School\r
\r
## The Transformation\r
\r
As the year progressed, we witnessed remarkable changes in both groups of students:\r
\r
### For the Rural Students\r
- Increased confidence in technology skills\r
- Improved language abilities\r
- Greater awareness of global opportunities\r
- Pride in their unique cultural knowledge and perspectives\r
\r
### For the Suburban Students\r
- More thoughtful consideration of resource consumption\r
- Appreciation for creativity with limited tools\r
- Interest in the rural language and culture\r
- Recognition of community strengths beyond material wealth\r
\r
## The Mathematical Art Finale\r
\r
Our final project showcased how far the partnership had evolved. Using TurtleArt, students collaborated on mathematical art pieces that incorporated elements from both cultures. The rural students, despite having fewer resources, often demonstrated more creative uses of TurtleArt's features, impressing their suburban counterparts.\r
\r
The project culminated in a virtual art gallery where student pairs presented their collaborative creations, explaining both the mathematical concepts and cultural elements incorporated in their designs.\r
\r
\r
## Lasting Impact\r
\r
Now in our second year of partnership, the impact extends beyond our original expectations:\r
\r
1. **Student Communication** continues outside formal projects via email and social media\r
2. **Family Involvement** has increased, with parents joining calls and contributing to cultural exchange elements\r
3. **School Administrations** from both institutions now support expanding the model to other classrooms\r
4. **Teacher Professional Development** has evolved as we share our experience with colleagues\r
\r
Most importantly, students from both schools have developed a more nuanced understanding of each other's worlds—recognizing both challenges and strengths in both contexts.\r
\r
As one student from the rural school reflected: "Before, I thought kids in the city had everything perfect. Now I see they have different problems, and sometimes they don't have some good things we have, like being close to nature and having family nearby all the time."\r
\r
And from a student in the suburban school: "I used to think I needed the newest technology to do cool stuff. The kids in the rural school showed me that imagination matters more than having the latest gear."\r
\r
## Conclusion\r
\r
Through the platform, our students discovered that meaningful collaboration doesn't require identical resources or circumstances—it requires creativity, curiosity, and tools that enable expression. In a world increasingly divided by technology access, the platform has helped our students build bridges rather than walls.\r
\r
The partnership continues to evolve, with new projects and new students joining each year. What began as an experimental connection between two classrooms has become a sustainable model for global education that honors both the universal nature of childhood curiosity and the unique perspectives that different contexts provide.\r

## What makes Sugar different?  \r
It would be nice to define what we are talking about when we say "Sugar," since we have multiple platforms. For example, is this page dedicated to Sugar as a desktop environment, or do we want to make this broader to include web apps, Sugarizer, etc.?  \r
\r
- **Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration**: children can write articles, share books, or make music together with a single mouse click.  \r
- **Activities, not applications**: Sugar activities are applicable beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.  \r
- **Automatic backup of Activity work**: No worrying about files or folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any data.  \r
- **The Journal records everything you do**: It is a place to reflect upon and evaluate your work.  \r
- **Sugar runs on most computer hardware**, including slower machines.  \r
- **Sugar is Free (Libre) Software**: It is written in Python and easily customized.  \r
- **Sugar is documented by its users**: It is easy to use, and teachers worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.  \r
- **Sugar is written by its users**: 50% of the updates to our latest release came directly from our users.  \r
  - It would be nice to have a link here, for reference.  \r
\r
## What are the benefits of using Sugar?  \r
- **Hundreds of tools for discovery**: Exploring, expressing, and sharing through online research, writing, coding, and more.  \r
- **Built-in collaboration system**: Peer-to-peer learning; always-on support; and single-click sharing.  \r
  - What is "always-on support"?  \r
- **A built-in portfolio assessment tool** called Journal that serves as a forum for discussion between children, parents, and teachers.  \r
- **A discoverable learning platform**: It uses simple means to reach complex ends.  \r
  - What do we mean by "discoverable"? That we can use the platform to discover ideas?  \r
- **Designed for local appropriation**: Sugar has built-in tools for making changes and improvements and a growing global community of support.  \r
  - Twenty-five languages are currently available.  \r
- **An emphasis on learning through doing and debugging**: Engages learners better to tackle authentic problems.  \r
- **Available in a wide variety of forms**: As part of GNU/Linux distributions, as well as LiveCD, LiveUSB, and in a virtual machine for Windows and Mac machines.  \r
\r
## What are the Sugar advantages?  \r
- **Pedagogical framework** centered around Constructionism learning and founded on student empowerment.  \r
- **Collaboration and journaling features**, uniquely designed by educators for educators and learners.  \r
- **Hundreds of activities**.  \r
- **Large and committed community** of developers, teachers, and learners from all around the globe.  \r
  - Perhaps it would be nice to have numbers here, if possible.  \r
- **24/7 community support**.  \r
  - What do we mean by this? That we are available by Matrix/IRC?  \r
- **Online and in-person training and workshops available**.  \r
- **Handouts available to use in the classroom**.  \r
- **Teacher-driven development**, rapidly expanding every day.  \r
- **Easily localizable and customizable**.  \r
- **Free/Libre software**: No licensing fees.  \r
- **A global project**: No single point of dependency or failure.  \r
\r
## A *learning-centric* approach  \r
At Sugar Labs, we strive for a *learning-centric* approach, where teachers mentor students as they engage with powerful ideas, or *instructing less and learning more*.  \r
\r
At Sugar Labs, we give children access to *knowledge*—through media such as electronic books, the world-wide web, and multimedia—but, more importantly, we give them the tools they need to *create*, to learn about learning, to put knowledge to use, and engage in reflection and critical dialogue.  \r
\r
With Sugar, we help learners *acquire knowledge* so that they grow as active consumers, critics, and *creators of knowledge*; Sugar welcomes them as members of a vibrant learning community.  \r
\r
Plus, cross-community collaboration between technologists and teachers ensures that the ideals of student empowerment, freedom, sharing, open critique, and transparency will remain an integral part of Sugar—one that touches the lives of children and their communities all across the world’s classrooms.  \r
\r
## The Free (Libre) Software culture  \r
The Sugar pedagogy is embodied in the culture of Free/Libre Software; teachers and students are empowered with both the freedom to actively participate and the freedom to be critical.  \r
\r
Criticism of ideas is a powerful force in learning, as well as in fostering economic development; unleashing this potential is an important part of our mission.\r

## Background  \r
The Sugar Learning Platform (Sugar) was first developed as the software platform for the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) program, a spin-off project from the MIT Media Lab in 2006.  \r
\r
The founders of OLPC, Nicholas Negroponte, Seymour Papert, and Walter Bender, promoted the idea that learning is not a luxury and that a lack of an educated society is not just an inconvenience. Learning is fundamental to a free society that aspires to be both prosperous and sustainable. All societies value the role that education plays in economic development, and education is essential to the survival of democratic societies.  \r
\r
Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon, co-inventors of the Logo programming language (along with Wally Feurzeig), described their pioneering efforts to use the Logo language as a vehicle for introducing children to computational thinking. They defined it in terms of heuristics: things to think with and reflect upon.  \r
\r
In 1971, Papert and Solomon published *“20 Things to do with a Computer”*, a catalog of project ideas ranging from robotics to music to visual arts. This work foreshadowed what today is often referred to as the *Maker Movement*. Almost 50 years ago, children were using Logo as a tool for the autonomous construction of meaningful artifacts and pursuing mastery in solving personally meaningful problems.  \r

In a 2008 essay questioning “general” education, Marvin Minsky proposed that we *“re-aim our schools towards encouraging children to pursue more focused hobbies and specialties—to provide them with more time for (and earlier experience with) developing more powerful sets of mental skills, which they later can extend to more academic activities.”*  \r
\r
Minsky encourages children to construct multi-level *cognitive towers*, built upon:  \r
- Instinctive reactions  \r
- Learned reactions  \r
- Deliberate thinking  \r
- Reflective thinking  \r
- Self-reflective thinking  \r
- Self-conscious reflection  \r
\r
These levels span agencies specializing in areas such as gaining knowledge from experience, planning and causal attribution, the construction of models, and identifying values and ideals.  \r
\r
A focus on achieving meaningful goals—not just the accumulation of simple knowledge objects—exercises all levels in a cognitive tower, helping children *develop proficiencies that can be used in other domains*. As a model for learning, the levels within Minsky’s cognitive towers represent broadly applicable skills.  \r
\r
Minsky’s towers are inherently complex and require a learner to be motivated and persistent in their construction—a process he once described as *"hard fun."*  \r
\r
This aligns with research by Daniel Pink, who reviewed four decades of studies showing that motivation for learning comes from:  \r
1. **Autonomy** – the freedom to explore and express ideas  \r
2. **Mastery** – confidence and space to develop expertise  \r
3. **Purpose** – authentic problem-solving opportunities  \r
\r
A key insight of Minsky, Papert, and Solomon is to give children tools they can explore, master, and apply to problems they care about. Children using Sugar are **motivated learners**, pursuing meaningful goals that help them build their own “cognitive towers.”`,I=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:u},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),p=`---\r

## Student and teacher agency\r
\r
Sugar provides the user with affordances (things we designed for the possibility of taking action by the user) and pathways to engage in developing skills. Sugar is not instructional curricula in part because curricula tend to reflect very local norms and needs, and as a consequence, are resistant to global solutions. \r
\r
Also, Sugar reflects an explicit rejection of instruction as a pedagogical framework. With Sugar, we try to give agency to the learner, knowing that in all likelihood, the institution of school would likely be trying to take away agency. At each design decision point, we asked ourselves:  \r
- *How will this impact the learning?*  \r
- *How will this impact the autonomy and agency of the learner and the teacher?*\r
\r
Agency is made possible in part because of the choice of a software license, the **General Public License (GPL)**, which ensures that the learner has permission to both use Sugar and to modify it. \r
\r
We go a step further by giving the learner affordances to engage in software development and debugging, i.e., to exploit the license. We provide a context for encouraging the learner to take initiative, both by deliberately leaving the platform “incomplete” and by providing a social norm in which it is expected to take initiative. Even if it were possible to make Sugar “complete”, we would have chosen not to. We wanted there always to be “itches” needing to be scratched.  \r
\r
In a related design decision, Sugar was never intended to be an endpoint in and of itself. Rather, we envisioned it as a waypoint along a lifelong journey of learning. We encourage our users to outgrow Sugar and even provide them with a means of advancing from the Sugar desktop, with its tools for exploration, to the **GNOME desktop**, with its more powerful tools for production.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## What using Sugar can do for your students and school?\r
\r
The **Sugar Learning Platform** was designed to promote collaborative learning through tools and activities that encourage critical thinking. Sugar puts an emphasis on divergent thinking. A related goal is to make that thinking visible to the learner. \r
\r
Sugar equally promotes cultures of **expression and reflection**. With Sugar, we provide teachers and learners with a collection of open-ended tools and activities, applicable to problems of their own choosing.\r
\r
### Sugar offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software based on three affordances:\r
\r
1. **Sharing:**  \r
   Collaboration is a first-order experience. The interface always shows the presence of other learners who are available for collaboration. Sugar allows users to dialog, support, critique, and share ideas with each other.\r
\r
2. **Reflecting:**  \r
   A "journal" records each learner’s activity. It is a built-in space for reflection and assessment of progress.\r
\r
3. **Discovering:**  \r
   Sugar tries to accommodate a wide variety of users with different levels of skill in terms of reading and language and different levels of experience with computing by providing activities with a "low floor" and, where possible, "no ceiling."\r
\r
>>> **“The only time collaboration is called cheating is when you are in school.” – Walter Bender**\r
\r
Sugar drew inspiration for its activities and the fluid interface between activities from observing how the **free software community** collaborates. Software developers chat, socialize, play games, share media, and collaborate on media creation and programming in both formal and informal settings.\r
\r
Sugar users are given access to a variety of commonly used tools for collaboration, e.g., **Chat and IRC**. By default, the IRC application opens into the \`#sugar\` channel on \`irc.freenode.net\`, where Sugar developers discuss their work.\r
\r

\r
## Reflection and assessment in the context of Sugar and interoperability with school administrative systems\r
\r
In the early days of the development of the Sugar user interface, one of the biggest points of contention with the OLPC advisory board was when we told them that we were not going to use **file browsing** as the primary mode of navigation. We were asked,  \r
*"How will the children learn to use Windows?"*  \r
Our response was, *"Why do they need to learn to use Windows?"*  \r
\r
Instead of browsing a filesystem, Sugar gives the user a **journal or notebook** into which one’s work is “kept” rather than “saved.” The interface tries to keep things that offer value automatically in the Sugar journal.\r
\r
The primary function of the journal is as a **time-based view** of the activities of a learner. As with physical media, such as pen on paper, no explicit "saving" step is needed. The individual journal entries are treated much like pages in a **laboratory notebook**.\r
\r
### Assessment in Sugar:\r
- **Digital Portfolio:**  \r
  Sugar journal entries are directly incorporated into **digital portfolios** to support reflection that can help students (as well as teachers and parents) be aware of their own learning.\r
- **Impact Measurement:**  \r
  Sugar acknowledges the need for **measurement and evaluation**. Sugar does not take a position on high-stake testing but advocates for an evaluation that looks more broadly than standardized tests.\r
- **Custom Metadata for Journal Entries:**  \r
  Teachers can know what tools a student may have used and how many iterations they made in creating an artifact.\r

## Student Learning Goals and Sugar\r
\r
>>>*"Learning with Sugar is something a child does, not something that is done to or for a child." – Walter Bender*\r
\r
Sugar is a collection of hundreds of tools designed to introduce children to programming, computational thinking, and problem-solving. Sugar has no set curriculum; its best practice is to immerse children in problem-solving and debugging. Children are given agency to work on problems they are passionate about in a context where there is an expectation that there were no predetermined solutions or prescribed paths to a solution. \r
\r
As Solomon observed, *“debugging is the greatest learning opportunity of the 21st century.”* While engaged in problem-solving, children are developing and refining the algorithms employed by the agents in the various levels of their cognitive towers.\r
\r
While computation and coding are at the heart of Sugar, Sugar is not a programming curriculum: computational thinking goes well beyond the realm of learning to code. While the specific algorithms they discuss—searching, sorting, optimal stopping, predicting, etc.—are useful in and of themselves, the real power of computational thinking lies in its systematic approach to debugging and problem-solving. \r
\r
Learning that problems can be addressed systematically is the underlying **“powerful idea”** of programming. The process of writing and then repairing or **debugging** a program provides a basis for active learning through trial and error, regardless of what the problem that is actually being solved.\r
